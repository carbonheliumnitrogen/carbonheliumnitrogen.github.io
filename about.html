    <h3> Hello! </h3>
    <img src="images/lad5.jpg" align="right" style="width:25%; margin: 0px 0px 0px 25px;">
    <p> I'm currently a student at MIT, where I am pursuing a Master's (S.M.) in Mechanical Engineering. 
        Previously, I obtained a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley - go Bears!
        All my life, I have been fascinated by flight; growing up, I was always the kid that stopped walking to follow an airplane as it traced a path into the clouds. Later on, I
        developed a habit of begging my parents to leave for the airport hours ahead of time so I could wander around
        the terminal and watch the action on the apron. Thanks to several fantastic math and science teachers, my
        passion for plane-spotting grew into one for engineering - I've always had the dream of designing and building
        something that could fly. I've been lucky enough to realize that dream through UC Berkeley's <a
            href="/seb.html">spaceshot rocketry team</a> throughout my time in college, which I can say with confidence
        has been the coolest project I've ever been a part of. </p>

    <p> The experience of building a composite airframe for the first time and holding the finished product in my hands
        immediately drew me in, and today my research interests lie in the intersection of 3D printing and composite
        materials. New materials have helped to make cars, planes, and rockets lighter and faster, and new techniques
        for manufacturing them place jaw-dropping results within our grasp. There is fascinating new research in both of
        these fields being published nearly every day, and I am excited to be here to witness our future being written.
        And all this way, I've been guided by my love of flight, of shooting for blue skies and bright stars. </p>

    <p> Thanks for stopping by! If you have questions or would like to chat, my contact information is below! </p>
