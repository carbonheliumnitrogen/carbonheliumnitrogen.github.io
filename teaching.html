    <p id="headerone"> I have been a student for my entire life. Correspondingly, I've encountered a great variety of teaching styles.
      Many of my own experiences as a student have inspired the way I think about teaching; my time on the teaching team for an undergraduate class
      has cemented some of these thoughts. I am constantly inspired by the great teachers I have had, and I am shaped by the experiences of the students I've met.
      My teaching philosophy can be summarized by the following points: <br>

      <ul>
        <li><em>Clarity in designing lectures and assignments.</em> It is a privilege, and a great responsibility, to introduce students to core concepts or topics which will 
            form the foundation of their education in mechanics. It is clear that this must be done deliberately and with tremendous care. In my teaching, I strive to introduce 
            advanced topics clearly and systematically, with a heavy emphasis on the <em>scaffolding</em> of concepts. For example, students should develop a 
            strong command over concepts related to deformation kinematics before constitutive laws are introduced.         
            Effective scaffolding requires ample opportunities for students to receive feedback on their learning. I like to provide worked examples with plenty of explanations,
            followed by a variety of exercises: some of which are similar to worked examples but others which go beyond extensions. (Students tend to be excellent 
            at pattern-matching without much thought.) You can see an example of this style in my <a href=/napkin.html>notes</a>.<br> <br>

            More broadly, each lecture and assignment should be constructed around clearly stated learning objectives. Just as we design instrumentation to experimentally measure
            the properties of materials, we should design lessons and formative assignments to assess students' understanding of these concrete objectives and to reinforce areas of weakness.
            Although mechanics is a field dominated by assessments of the "worked problem" type (e.g., "find the stress field given the deformation"), a key tool for assessing 
            understanding is the use of open-ended concept questions. Asking students to explain a concept <em>in their own words</em> is a straightforward method of evaluating 
            how they build and connect ideas in their minds.
        </li>
        <
        <li><em>Enthusiasm.</em> You have undoubtedly had the experience of sitting in a lecture hall while the instructor either (i) reads text directly off of a presentation at the 
        rate of a million slides per minute, or (ii) stands with their back to the room, copying notes onto the chalkboard, maybe saying a few words in a monotone voice. It goes without
        saying that this lack of enthusiasm is passed on to students, who consequently lose interest in the content of the course as soon as they leave the room. 
        Conversely, one of my favorite teachers could have had a second career in acting. His interaction with the class was vibrant, dynamic, and memorable: he would use the classroom
        like a stage, he would change the dynamics and the tempo of his voice during the course of the lecture, and his boardwork consisted of only the essential content, so he wouldn't
        succumb to the awkward silence associated with writing long sentences with his back turned. <br> <br>
        
        Now, admittedly, my personality is generally more reserved than that, but I try to embody this enthusiasm in my own teaching. Thinking of each class presentation (lecture, 
        review session, even laboratory session) as a kind of performance helps to keep students engaged. Like playing Chopin, or like a quarterback running an effective two-minute drill,
        controlling the tempo is everything. When I prepare the appropriate material, I organize it to be centered around one or more key messages, then I build up to each one, slow down 
        for emphasis, then move on. When I am visibly excited and enthusiastic about the content, I have found that the students will match my energy. There's no better feeling.
        </li>
        
        <li><em>Learning by doing.</em> Having worked with 100+ students in upper-division mechanics classes, an overwhelming majority of them self-categorize as "kinesthetic", i.e., 
        they say they learn best by doing. (Indeed, there's no faster way to turn a sleepy after-lunch lab session into a lively, conversational environment than to get students up 
        and moving through activities.) Hence, I try to introduce and incorporate active learning time alongside the traditional passive learning pervasive throughout 
        engineering lecture-style courses. Laboratory sessions are the easiest way to do this, but sometimes lectures are necessary. Active learning in the lecture hall can include
        simple activities like working with a partner or small group to answer a question or work a problem, or getting students involved in classroom demonstrations. 
        These activities also break up long lecture sessions and help with pacing, as much as they do with retention and reinforcment of material. The best activities and demonstrations
        are ones that students will remember long after they've finished the course.
